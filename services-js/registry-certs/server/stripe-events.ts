// features. If the charge succeeded, THE ORDER MUST BE PLACED for the customer.
// If we tried to do this inline in the mutation after the charge API call,
// there’s a chance that the database write would fail, or the email wouldn’t
// send.
//
// If those things happen in this case, we’ll send a 500 back to Stripe and it
// will retry. If it keeps failing, Stripe will notify us of the issue.
//
// Note that there is a non-zero chance that Stripe will call this twice for the
// same charge, meaning we will send 2 emails to the customer about the order.
// That’s a better choice than not sending an email at all or causing delays in
// fulfillment, so we can live with it.
