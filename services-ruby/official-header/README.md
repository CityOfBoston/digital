An official header that can be included by sites that are official City websites, but not Boston.gov. To get the header installed, owners of the site need to get this javascript included in the HTML of their site.

```js
<script src="https://officialheader.boston.gov/header.js" async=true></script>
```

It is recommended to add this to the `<head>` tag of every page for the site. 

Once added, send an email to feedback@boston.gov with your domain to get added to the list of approved sites - it won't work otherwise. For testing purposes `localhost` is always allowed.

[See an example of what this looks like.](https://officialheader.boston.gov/)
