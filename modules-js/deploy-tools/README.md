Deploy tools for City of Boston’s Digital Team

These tools are used in deploying webapps from our monorepo:
[CityOfBoston/digital](https://github.com/CityOfBoston/digital)

“Published” locally as an `npm pack`ed tgz file so we can use it with `npx`
without needing to install all of the monorepo’s dependencies to do deploy
tasks.
